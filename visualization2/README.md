This graph shows 2014 data from the Environmental Information Agency on state-level CO2 emissions and energy consumption. The buttons at the bottom of the page are designed to let the user toggle between these 2 statistics.

User issues:
A few items could not be fixed in the allocated sprint time; I would like to have focused on these on a theoretical next sprint. These include:

-Some sort of text for the legend, to allow the user to easily pair the different gradations of blue with distinct levels of emissions/consumption
-Changing the subtitle/hover text, to reflect the fact that while CO2 emissions are measured here in millions of metric tons, energy consumption is measured in millions of BTUs (British thermal unit, a standard measure of energy).
