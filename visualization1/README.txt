Our group selected the visualization chart from http://romsson.github.io/dragit/example/nations.html.
With this chart, we attempted to visualize the trend with respect to CO2 emission rate versus GDP per capita rate in the period of 1974-2008.
We also changed life expectancy variable of the original chart with CO2 emission data, which can be found in the folder attached to this repository.
